## Acknowledgements

I am still in the learning phase, so the programs in this repository reflect my current understanding of C programming. I am constantly improving and trying to implement new concepts. Please note that while these programs have been tested, I am not responsible for any issues caused by running them in different environments.

Thank you for visiting my repository and joining me in my learning process.

With due respect,
